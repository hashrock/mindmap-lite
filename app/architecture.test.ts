/**
 * Guards the layering described in CLAUDE.md / prior refactors: domain has no
 * internal deps, and each layer only reaches "inward" —
 *   domain <- lib <- application <- components <- pages
 * — never sideways into db/utils (server infrastructure) or "outward" into a
 * layer built on top of it. A violation here is a real regression (e.g. lib
 * reaching into application) even though nothing throws at runtime; nothing
 * else catches that shape of bug.
 *
 * Server-side buckets (db, utils, auth, scenarios) sit beside that chain:
 * they may use the pure layers and each other as listed, but no UI layer may
 * reach into them.
 *
 * The layering check only resolves relative specifiers, so it can't see a
 * bare `from "react"` — a separate check below guards domain/lib/application
 * against that blind spot specifically.
